		A never ending stream of failure follows below...
		
		So basically, i'm failing at vhosts now.  It's kind of hard to 'wrap' my mind around it mostly because
		i think i don't understand how computers communicate, like http (whatever the hell that is)
		what's it contains, how a couchdb understands it, etc.  I'm sure some smart elitestIslamoFascistCommieIndustrialComplexiestNeoConLiberal could explain it to me
		or i could just fail forward and report all of my findings.  
	
		So i'm just going to keep a running list of things i've tried and how they've failed.  
		
		My first goal is to make the two images below this paragraph section appear.  
		
		however, when adding vhosts, my cygwin fails hardcore with couchapp push online (i have defined .couchapprc that pushes correctly without a vhost)
		
		so here are my trials with vhosts
		
		{
			section:vhosts,
			option:failure.couchone.com,
			value:/blog/_design/blog/index.html
		}
		
		result: failure.couchone.com loads but pictures do not load
		
		vhosts as
		{
			section:vhosts,
			option:failure.couchone.com,
			value:/blog/_design/blog/_rewrite
		}
		
		with a rewrites.json inside the _design as
		[
			{
				"from":"",
				"to":"index.html"
			},
			{
				"from":"/blog/*",
				"to":"../../*"
			}
		]
		
		result: images come in good.
		check 'test' database with /test/_design/test/index.html
		
		result:failure
		odd, can't find the database...
		try changing vhosts

	but this somehow busts my couchapp in all kinds of new cool awesome ways.
	
	push from cygwin.  yes, im using cygwin.  REAL MEN FIGHT WITH THEIR OS'S IN AN EPIC BATTLE OF JUST NOT SUCKING.  you freaking mac guys are so soft.
	
	anywayz,
	
	so i can now type http://failure.couchone.com and it'll redirect to /blog/_design/blog/index.html
	
	because i defined inside my vhosts a key value of
	
	{"failure.couchone.com" : "/blog/_design/blog/_rewrite"}
	
	inside the blog design file i have a rewrite defined as 
	
[{
	"from":"",
	"to":"index.html"
}]

which now allows me to serve this piece of blog awesomeness to you.

and allows me to pimp some terrible code i've worked on.  

like a terrible chatting program with a rudimentary test code suite:
<a href="http://failure.couchone.com/chat/_design/chat/index.html" target="_blank">a terrible chat program with a rudimentary test code suite</a>
<a href="http://failure.couchone.com/finalmusicplayer/_design/finalMusicPlayer/index.html" target="_blank">or an even worse musicplayer</a>

however, by doing this kind of crazy superawesomesauce, i can no longer push by cygwin and couchapp, i get a generated error.
