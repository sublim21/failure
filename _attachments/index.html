		So basically, I've spent the last few days failing at vhosts and re-writes. 
		
		Max Ogden was kind enough to record a webcast explaining pretty urls (<a href="http://vimeo.com/20773112"><img style="width:1em;" src="http://failure.couchone.com:5984/blog/d8db979a54b0bd8eb0778f57b5002eb6/link.jpg"></img>AGE</a>)
		but I still can't get accomplish my goal which i'm hoping someone can please explain to me how to accomplish.
		
		My Goal is to serve the design document located at /blog/_design/blog/index.html
		
		at the location failure.couchone.com
		(which btw, it's currently doing)
		
		but in a way that doesn't 'bust' the other code i've written.  For example, try accessing the following test design file which is the basic couchapp
		<a href="/test/_design/test/index.html" target="_blank">href is set to /test/_design/test/index.html</a>
		
		you're returned the document located at the location, not an executing design document.
		
		In fact, all of my references outside of /blog/ are 'messed up' and i don't know/understand why.
		
		
		My current settings are as follows:
		
		I've created a vhosts file as per Maxs' video with the following key:value pair
		
		{
			failure.couchone.com : /blog/_design/blog/_rewrite
		}
		
		inside the blog design document i've created a rewrites.json with the following object
		
		[
			{
				"from":"",
				"to":"index.html"
			},
			{
				"from":"/blog/*",
				"to":"../../*"
			},
			{
				"from":"*",
				"to":""
			}
		]
		
		This allows me to serve you the page you're currently reading from the app at /blog/_design/blog/index.html Images work, but scripts with hrefs like /script/jquery-1.4.4.min.js won't work
		neither will css btw (so excuse the 'awesomeness' of this page)
		
		I'd really appreciate someone going:
		
		HEY YOU:
			DO THIS
		
		In a manner I can understand.
		
		and if you wanna be superawesomecool LIKE THESE FELLOWS

			The more interesting thing about this image is that it made sense to a few people in a relatively short amount of time.  And those people?  they're making things you could possibly use.

		you can explain to me a hurrduurRRr manner where the fault lies in my understanding of 
		
		
		So here's my
		
		The second is sending things it 'finds' from the source of blog up to spaces with the rest of the stuff after the slash
		
		But if i ran rewrite purely as 
		
		[
			{
				"from":"",
				"to":"index.html"
			},
			{
				"from":"/blog/*",
				"to":"../../*"
			}
		]		
		
		I can't even access failure.couchone.com/test/_design/test/index.html 
		or anything else for that matter.  like stupid pictures.  Likes This one
		
		
		  
		
		 
		 but, r

		However, i still can't 'wrap' my mind around it.  Particularly how to handle hrefs, links and the like within a webpage.

		So I
		however, i'm still failing at achieving my end goal. 
		i'm failing at vhosts now.  It's kind of hard to 'wrap' my mind around it mostly because
		i think i don't understand how computers communicate, like http (whatever the hell that is)
		what's it contains, how a couchdb understands it, etc.  I'm sure some smart elitestIslamoFascistCommieIndustrialComplexiestNeoConLiberal could explain it to me
		or i could just fail forward and report all of my findings.  
	
		So i'm just going to keep a running list of things i've tried and how they've failed.  
		
		My first goal is to make the two images below this paragraph section appear.  
		
		however, when adding vhosts, my cygwin fails hardcore with couchapp push online (i have defined .couchapprc that pushes correctly without a vhost)
		
		so here are my trials with vhosts
		
		{
			section:vhosts,
			option:failure.couchone.com,
			value:/blog/_design/blog/index.html
		}
		
		result: failure.couchone.com loads but pictures do not load
		
		vhosts as
		{
			section:vhosts,
			option:failure.couchone.com,
			value:/blog/_design/blog/_rewrite
		}
		
		with a rewrites.json inside the _design as
		[
			{
				"from":"",
				"to":"index.html"
			},
			{
				"from":"/blog/*",
				"to":"../../*"
			}
		]
		
		result: images come in good.
		check 'test' database with /test/_design/test/index.html
		
		result:failure
		odd, can't find the database...
		try changing vhosts

	<a href="http://failure.couchone.com/test/_design/test/index.html" target="_blank">this link should open failure.couchone.com/test/_design/test/index.html</a>
	</br>
	<a href="/test/_design/test/index.html" target="_blank">this link should open failure.couchone.com/test/_design/test/index.html</a>

	<p>
	but this somehow busts my couchapp in all kinds of new cool awesome ways.
	
	push from cygwin.  yes, im using cygwin.  REAL MEN FIGHT WITH THEIR OS'S IN AN EPIC BATTLE OF JUST NOT SUCKING.  you freaking mac guys are so soft.
	
	anywayz,
	
	so i can now type http://failure.couchone.com and it'll redirect to /blog/_design/blog/index.html
	
	because i defined inside my vhosts a key value of
	
	{"failure.couchone.com" : "/blog/_design/blog/_rewrite"}
	
	inside the blog design file i have a rewrite defined as 
	
[{
	"from":"",
	"to":"index.html"
}]

which now allows me to serve this piece of blog awesomeness to you.

and allows me to pimp some terrible code i've worked on.  

like a terrible chatting program with a rudimentary test code suite:
<a href="http://failure.couchone.com/chat/_design/chat/index.html" target="_blank">a terrible chat program with a rudimentary test code suite</a>
<a href="http://failure.couchone.com/finalmusicplayer/_design/finalMusicPlayer/index.html" target="_blank">or an even worse musicplayer</a>

however, by doing this kind of crazy superawesomesauce, i can no longer push by cygwin and couchapp, i get a generated error.
